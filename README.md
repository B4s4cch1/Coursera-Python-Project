This project uses requests and beautifulsoup for web scraping a web page to get the 10 top banks.
We save the information using pandas and transform it using numpy.
Then we use pandas to save the information into a csv file and into a database.
After all of that we use pandas to retrieve the information using three different queries.
During all the process we register it in the code_log.txt file
